Do you agree or disagree that young people today have no influence on the important decisions that determine the future of society as a whole.  

Writing
======
In modern society, almost all the officer who determine the policy directly are elder people. This phenomenon give rise to the statement that young people today have no influence on the important decisions that determine the future of society as whole. However, fact doesn't stand with it. Multiple plausible truths have proved that young people today, have never loss their influence on society's decision making.

As the development of internet, the youth community is playing a more and more significant role in the society. One of the most important contributory factors is social media. Young people are main part of social media, and they can easily form groups with similar appeal because they are more willing to express and discuss on the internet. Once the group becomes big enough, their voice will be seriously taken into consideration. Meanwhile, Medias also prefer to cover social issue related to youth, since they are more attractive and host-selling. For instance, there was a girl whose seat was forcibly occupied by another man in the same train. After the breakdown of negotiation, the girl recorded a video and put it on the internet. Then tons of youth took part in the discussion derived from the girlâ€™s video. The media start to report it, and ultimately drive the government to introduce relevant polices to protect people's right. From the social event, we can make it clear that with the help of internet, especially social media, youth group can have an effect on the social roles.

Except for influencing directly by the way above, there is also an indirect channel which make it possible for youth to make a difference. If you drop into a cinema, you will find that most people there are youth, especially when a cartoon film is projecting. Meanwhile, you will find that there are more cartoon films these years. Why? Undoubtedly, because youth love coming into cinema and cartoon films appeal them much more. Where is the need, where is the development of commerce? Youth's demand can affect the structure of industry and thus can guide the focus of government.

Last but not least, we can also see that lots of young people are influencing the world individually. The novel price of peace has ever given to a little girl, and even a high school student can publish far-reaching papers on top international conferences. We must admit that young people are becoming more influential, not only because of external factors, but also because they are more intelligent and powerful, which makes them more qualified to make decisions and make difference. 

People always say that future is in youth's hand. It's not a lie with kindness, but an incontrovertible truth, supporting by many plausible truth that youth can make a difference to society's decision, directly or indirectly, as a whole or individually.
