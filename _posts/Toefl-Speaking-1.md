Some Speaking Task1 question and answer
1. 第一坑：结尾
结尾不重要，不一定非要结尾，除了用来充时间，没其他用！ <br>
说不完其实也还行，口语第一题不是考察这些东西，最后有一点细节没说完，比剩下很多时间好多多多多了。 <br>
整个口语测试的目的是为了测试在大学与教授同学进行学术交流的能力，甚至都不需要presentation的能力。口语的逻辑表达=making sense。  <br>

2. 第二坑：分论点个数
分论点的个数也不是重要的，ETS想要考察的不是这个。把论点讲述清楚，一个两个三个都行。解释要**make sense**！ 细节充实，有展开有解释。 <br>

3. 第三坑：详细的例子
不一定要有详细的例子！看题目要求。什么是详细的例子，清晰地点明论点就是详细的例子，两句话也可以，拒绝特别长特别冗余的例子。其实案例本身就是 detailed example.

4. 第四坑：特定结构与模板
口语逻辑就是答之所问，言之有理，就是make sense。

1. **TV programs:**<br>
Personally, I think parents should supervise what their children watch on TV for many reasons.<br>
Firstly, TV is always flooded with lots of criminal and violent scenes, which are especially bad for children. Parents should prevent them from watching those scenes because they might try to imitate the actions and put them into use.<br>
Secondly, parents should also limit the amount of time children watch TV. Many TV programs are very addictive. With little self-control, children are likely to watch TV for a long period of time. In this way, they might end up having poor eyesight.<br>
// This why I think children should not have the choice to watch whatever they want on TV.
	
2. **Teaching music and art or not?** <br>
Personally, I think high school should teach its students music and art for many reasons.<br>
Firstly, school is a place to bring up persons, instead of produce social machines. Students need to learn music and art to develop themselves all round, and schools should give them enough opportunities.<br>
Secondly, different subjects  are not separated totally. Learning music and art can also help students to understand their major/ main courses deeper and better. As we all know, most monumental scientists are also great musicians or artists, like Einstein and DaVinci.<br>
// That why I think music and art should also be thought in high schools.
	
3. **Some parents always try to prevent their children from making mistakes, while some parents allow their kids to commit mistakes, thinking such experience helpful. Which opinion do you agree and why?** <br>
Personally, I think parents should allowed their children to make mistakes for many reasons. <br>
Firstly, no one can prevent from making mistakes, even for an experienced elder, let alone a  children. It's quite normal for a children to do things wrong. Parents should put up with it. They may also have made those mistakes when they were young. <br>
Secondly, children has an amazing ability of learning. After they made a mistake, they would be less prone to them. (For example, if children mistakenly spell English words, they will obtain a clear impression on the right spelling after realizing that.) The more mistakes a person makes in childhood, the less mistakes they will make when they grow up. <br>
// That's why I think kids shouldn't be prevented from making mistake.
	
4. **Some people think historical sites ought to be open to the general public, while some people think historical sites should only be open to experts and researchers. Which opinion do you agree and why? Give specific explanation in your response.** <br>
Personally, I think historical sites ought to be open to the general public for many reasons. <br>
Firstly, historical sites is not only a tourist attractions, but also an indispensable source/component of historical knowledge. People can know part of the history more vividly while visiting those historical sites. These experience can never be taught by books and lessons.<br>
Secondly, historical sites doesn't belong to any person or organizations, everyone should have the rights to visit it. Though some visitors may do harm to the sites deliberately, it's not a plausible solution to just radically prevent all visitors from visiting them. Instead, we must establish a more standardized management system to protect those sites. <br>

5. **Some students believe that students should choose what courses they learn by themselves, while some students believe that professors should make decisions for students. Which opinion do you support? Give specific explanation in your response.** <br>
Personally, I think students should choose what courses they learn by themselves for many reasons.<br>
Firstly, only by making choice by students themselves, can students get the courses they want. If a student was assigned a course that he doesn't like by professor, he might not learn it well, as we all know that interest is the best teacher. <br>
Secondly, making choice is also an indispensable ability which student must own. Professor cannot make choice for their students through all their life. Students have to learn how to make decisions before they leave the school. <br>
// That why I think professor shouldn't take the rights of making decisions away from students.

6. **Should animals be given the same rights like human?** <br>
Personally, I think animals should not be given the same rights like human for many reasons.<br>
Firstly, people have a lot of rights, which forms our complexed society. There are tons of social problem with only humans in it, let alone adding animals in it. I don't think we are ready to allow animals to be part of our society.<br>
Secondly, animals, as well as human beings, are all part of our earth ecosystem. The nature has it strict rules. Giving animals the same rights as human will totally break the law of nature, which might bring about destructive effects on our environment.<br>
// That's why I think animals should not be given so much human-rights.

7. **Do you think sports courses should be a required part of every school day.** <br>
Personally I think, sports courses must be a component of every school day, most of us have underestimated the tremendous value of sports courses.
Firstly, sports courses can help maintain the physical fitness of students. Only with a health body, can they learn better without being disturbed by illness. Besides, exercise can help people secrete more hormone, which may keep students being  concentrated and enthusiastic in school.
Secondly, sports courses can help strengthen the sportsmanship among students. They will learn how to cooperate with each other in team contest, and learn to try their best when overcoming difficulties. <br>
// Therefore, sports courses should be a required part of students' everyday life. 

8. **Some students like classes where teachers lecture in class. Other students prefer classes where the students do some of the talking. Which type of class do you prefer?** <br>
Personally, I llike the first way. There are two main reasons for my choice. <br>
Firstly, students are less experienced to do teaching job. As we all know, it may take many years of training to become a teacher. It's always hard for a student to give a lesson without enough background knowledge and ability to handle exceptions.
Secondly, it's the teacher's duty instead of student's job to give lectures. Though by preparing a talk might give a trainning to student. However, if it will take too much time, and thus will take up the time of other courses. <br>
// That why I don't like the second kinds of class.

9. **Do you agree or disagree that college students should do an internship before graduation?** <br>
I think it's a good idea for college students to do an intership before graduation. <br>
Firstly, while doing an intership, students can learn a lot which won't be taught at school. They will use what they learn form school to handle the true problem, and they may learn how to coorperate with others of the company. These abilities is equally important compared with professional knowledge.
Secondly, doing an internship can give students a way to meet new friends, and build social relationship, which is vitally important after they graduate from school.<br>
// That why I can not encourage undergraduates to do intership any more.

10. **Do you agree or disagree that students will learn more when they have discussions?** <br>
Agree.
