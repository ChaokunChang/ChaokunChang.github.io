1. TV programs:
	Personally, I think parents should supervise what their children watch on TV for many reasons.
	Firstly, TV is always flooded with lots of criminal and violent scenes, which are especially bad for children. Parents should prevent them from watching those scenes because they might try to imitate the actions and put them into use.
	Secondly, parents should also limit the amount of time children watch TV. Many TV programs are very addictive. With little self-control, children are likely to watch TV for a long period of time. In this way, they might end up having poor eyesight.
	This why I think children should not have the choice to watch whatever they want on TV.
	
2. Teaching music and art or not?
	Personally, I think high school should teach its students music and art for many reasons.
	Firstly, school is a place to bring up persons, instead of produce social machines. Students need to learn music and art to develop themselves all round, and schools should give them enough opportunities.
	Secondly, different subjects  are not separated totally. Learning music and art can also help students to understand their major/ main courses deeper and better. As we all know, most monumental scientists are also great musicians or artists, like Einstein and DaVinci.
	That why I think music and art should also be thought in high schools.
	
3. Some parents always try to prevent their children from making mistakes, while some parents allow their kids to commit mistakes, thinking such experience helpful. Which opinion do you agree and why?
	Personally, I think parents should allowed their children to make mistakes for many reasons. 
	Firstly, no one can prevent from making mistakes, even for an experienced elder, let alone a  children. It's quite normal for a children to do things wrong. Parents should put up with it. They may also have made those mistakes when they were young. 
	Secondly, children has an amazing ability of learning. After they made a mistake, they would be less prone to them. (For example, if children mistakenly spell English words, they will obtain a clear impression on the right spelling after realizing that.) The more mistakes a person makes in childhood, the less mistakes they will make when they grow up. 
	That's why I think kids shouldn't be prevented from making mistake.
	
4. Some people think historical sites ought to be open to the general public, while some people think historical sites should only be open to experts and researchers. Which opinion do you agree and why? Give specific explanation in your response.
	Personally, I think historical sites ought to be open to the general public for many reasons. 
	Firstly, historical sites is not only a tourist attractions, but also an indispensable source/component of historical knowledge. People can know part of the history more vividly while visiting those historical sites. These experience can never be taught by books and lessons.
  Secondly, historical sites doesn't belong to any person or organizations, everyone should have the rights to visit it. Though some visitors may do harm to the sites deliberately, it's not a plausible solution to just radically prevent all visitors from visiting them. Instead, we must establish a more standardized management system to protect those sites.
