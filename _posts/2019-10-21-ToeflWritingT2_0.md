Writing analyse and thought
======
要凑够字数，一定就得多写，学学如何通过内容展开来丰富文章。
1. 首先第一段，引出论点的时候应该如何做？<br>
  先简单nowadays一下，引出问题本身或者反方论点出现的原因。然后Though一下或者一句话指出论点的问题，引出本文论点。
2. 分论点展开怎么搞？
  提出分论点，用一句细节解释论点。如果想不出细节，那么有可能是分论点太明确了，或者是思维被限制了。要么改改分论点，把分论点改短一些或者简单（simple and conlusive words）一些。展开的时候把这些缺失补上。多提几个为什么，或者从另一角度切入，把分论点从大的地方往小的地方引，最后在引到总论点上。然后举例，把事情简单说清楚，然后，Therefore, through this event, we can find that ... / we can conclude that ... / ,引导分论点或者总论点上。
  另一种方法：如果分论点展开时发现文章中只有分论点和总论点两个关键词，这样是一定展不开的。可以添加论点背景或者逻辑推导过程。简言之就是看看分论点的关键词逻辑之间可以加什么，添加中间产物。
3. 如果分论点字数不够，可以在分论点上引出一个印象因素(controbutory factors),简单引出一两个(sole or two main factors)factor来展开。 另外还可以通过对比来展开，如果题目中隐含对比关系，不如人群的对比，方式的对比，背景条件的对比等等，完全可以作为example的一种替代品。
4. 实在写不出来，可以使用假设和反证，进行逻辑推理来丰富内容和加强逻辑性。这个东西可以写得很长也可以很短。建议在文章中的一个分论点上进行这种展开。
5. 两个分论点写完了还是字数不够，有时间就写一个refutation, 说出反方论点的局限性，假设反方论点是正确的会怎么怎么样，或者写个concession，说一下尽管反方论点在什么情况下是正确的，但是大多数情况下我方论点更对，更有价值....
6. 总结咋写？
    In a summary... 换一种方法重述一下总论点，最好再统筹一下两个分论点。甚至还能升华一下。最后一句怎么写？应该落在哪里？应该收在总论点上或者对反方论点轻微的反驳上。

如何写contributory factors? 如何写comparison? 如何写Assumption/hypothesis和proof by contradiction?
