This is Chaokun's Homepage, welcome!

Chaokun is currently an undergraduate student of Fudan University, majoring in Computer Science and Technology, elite class. His research interest locates in Network and System, especially in Distributed System and Database. He is also a memeber of DSALab (Data Analysis and Security Laboratory) of Fudan University, supervised by Zhengying He. In DASLab, he mainly learns about the retrieving approaches on Geo-Point.
