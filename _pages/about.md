This is Chaokun's Homepage, welcome!

Chaokun is currently an M.Phil student at CSE Department, CUHK(The Chinese University of Hong Kong), supervised by Prof. [Eric Lo](https://appsrv.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~ericlo/). I'm working on approximate query processing on large data and unstructured data (e.g. video). Besides, he is also interested in efficient model training and inference, as well as application of machine learning model in system research. 


Before joining CUHK, Chaokun got his bachelor degree from Fudan University in Computer Science and Technology, elite class. During his undergraduate, he is also a memeber of DSALab (Data Analysis and Security Laboratory) of Fudan University, supervised by Prof. [Zhengying He](https://daslab.fudan.edu.cn/61/80/c26852a287104/page.htm).

Chaokun is also a fan of magic and comic. In his spare time, he often learns some magic tricks and sometimes gives a show in school activites. If you are also a magic fan, welcome to contact him!
